    "Since we've just reviewed Python and NumPy usage, you may be wondering why we need TensorFlow for Deep Learning, instead of staying within the confines of only Python or NumPy. While certain aspects of the Python language make it convenient to use in many cases, they come with efficiency tradeoffs that render pure Python nearly unuseable when working with the large datasets necessary for training deep learning models.  For instance, Python is *dynamically typed*, which means that Python stores in memory the information about a variable's type. This requires extra memory allocation and also necessitates what are called *runtime type checks*, in which Python looks up a variable's type whenever operations are performed using that variable. NumPy mitigates some of these inefficiencies with its arrays, which are more compactly stored in memory because all elements in an array are of the same type (compared to, say, a Python list). NumPy takes advantage of this compact representation to perform quick array manipulations using operations implemented in C. \n",
    "\n",
    "While individual NumPy operations are efficient, stringing these operations together introduces a slowdown.  This is because between each NumPy operation, computation goes back and forth between the Python interpreter and underlying C code of NumPy. NumPy also experiences another drawback specific to deep learning. As you'll learn, a canonical algorithm for training deep models uses *backpropagation*, which requires the calculation of gradients. Before TensorFlow and other similar libraries, programmers manually (i.e., using pen and paper) did the calculus, deriving the symbolic gradient of the function to be minimized, then writing special code to take partial derivatives at an arbitrary input point. This is mechanical work that a computer should be able to do automatically. But NumPy's structure does not provide an easy way of computing these derivatives automatically. Why? Automatically computing the derivative of some formula requires having some representation of that formula in memory. But when you run NumPy operations, they simply execute and return their results; no trace is left of the steps used to get from first input to final output. There is no easy way to go back and compute derivatives later on in a program."

In this paradigm, a programmer describes the entire desired computation, capturing it in a representation known as a \"graph.\"  To use graph-theory parlance, the nodes of a computation graph are the operations to be performed, and the edges of the graph represent the data flowing from one operation to another. Constructing a graph establishes the formula of the computation and stores it in memory.  \n",

While TensorFlow supports the creation of multiple graphs, in practice, this is rarely done; for the rest of this course (and likely for the rest of your time using TensorFlow), you'll be using the default graph.\n",

Each operation accepts some number of inputs (0 or more) and produces 0 or more outputs, which can then possibly be passed on to other operations. The execution of an operation might also incur such side-effects as printing to the console, writing to a file, or modifying a variable in memory. The Operation object describes all of this computation, but the computation does not occur until the graph is completely built and then run.  As a shorthand for the term \"TensorFlow Operation\", it is not uncommon to see \"op\" instead.\n",

In \"Hello, TensorFlow\", the single output tensor of the `tf.constant` function is `hello`. It's important to note that the string \"Hello, TensorFlow\" is not actually stored in the `hello` tensor. Instead, the tensor refers to that piece of data that will be computed when the graph is run. \n",
